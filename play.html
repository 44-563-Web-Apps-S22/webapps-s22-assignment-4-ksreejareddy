<h4>Act II: The scene is between Orgon, Mariane </h4>
    Orgon.     Mariane.<br>
    Mariane.   Yes.<br>
    Orgon.     Come here.We need to speak Privately <br>         
    Mariane.   Father, what is it you seek?<br>
    Orgon.     [looking in the closet]. 
               I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us.
               This is a perfect place for such a purpose.
               There now, it's okay.  Mariane, I find
               You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind
               And you have always been most dear to me.<br>
    Mariane.   A father's love brings true felicity.<br>
    Orgon.     Well said, my child!  And to earn it fully
              You should devote yourself to contenting me.<br>
    Mariane.  That's how my devotion is put to the proof.<br>
    Orgon.    Good.  
              Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?<br>
    Mariane.  Who me?<br>
    Orgon.    You.  
              Think well before you reply.<br>
    Mariane.  Oh my! Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.<br>
    [Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen]<br>
    Orgon.    That's sensibly spoken. Now tell me, girl,
              That his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,
              That he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice
              To have him be your husband by my choice.
              Eh?<br>
    [Mariane recoils in dismay.]<br>
    Mariane.  Eh?<br>
    Orgon.    What's that?<br>
