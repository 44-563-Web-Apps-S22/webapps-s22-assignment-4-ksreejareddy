    <h6 class="name Mariane">Mariane</h6>   
    <p class="speech">Yes..</p>     
    <h6 class=" name Orgon">Orgon</h6>     
    <p class="speech">Come here.We need to speak Privately</p> <br>         
    <h6 class="name Mariane">Mariane</h6>   
    <p class="speech">Father, what is it you seek?</p><br>
    <h6 class=" name Orgon">Orgon</h6>     
    <p class="speech">[looking in the closet].  
               I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us.
               This is a perfect place for such a purpose.
               There now, it's okay.  Mariane, I find
               You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind
               And you have always been most dear to me.</p><br>
    <h6 class="name Mariane">Mariane</h6>  
    <p class="speech">g A father's love brings true felicity.</p><br>
    <h6 class=" name Orgon">Orgon</h6>   
    <p class="speech"> Well said, my child!  And to earn it fully
              You should devote yourself to contenting me.</p><br>
    <h6 class="name Mariane">Mariane</h6> 
    <p class="speech">That's how my devotion is put to the proof.</p><br>
    <h6 class=" name Orgon">Orgon</h6>    
    <p class="speech">Good.
    Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?</p><br>
    <h6 class="name Mariane">Marine</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Who me?</p><br>
    <h6 class=" name Orgon">Orgon</h6>  
    <p class="speech">You.  
    Think well before you reply.</p><br>
    <h6 class="name Mariane">Marine</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Oh my! Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.</p><br>
    [Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen]<br>
    <h6 class=" name Orgon">Orgon</h6>   
    <p class="speech">That's sensibly spoken. Now tell me, girl,
              That his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,
              That he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice
              To have him be your husband by my choice.
              Eh?</p><br>
    [Mariane recoils in dismay.]<br>
    <h6 class="name Mariane">Marine</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Eh?</p><br>
    <h6 class=" name Orgon">Orgon</h6>
    <p class="speech">What's that?<br></p>
